   <p>Are you tired of listening to the same old EDM songs? Tired of sifting through countless remixes and websites just to find a new song you like?  Are you going to shoot yourself in the foot if you hear &quot;Levels&quot; one more time?</p>

    <p>Then you have come to the right place.</p>

    <p>Welcome to EDM Headquarters.</p>

    <h3><strong>What is EDM Headquarters?</strong></h3>

    <p>EDM Headquarters is your go to source for all that is Electronic Dance Music. We provide all types of EDM content, from original singles to live sets, in an organized ranking that is created by you, the user.</p>

   <h3><strong>Why was EDM Headquarters created?</strong></h3>

   <p>EDM Headquarters was born out of sheer frustration with the EDM industry. Due to the fact than anyone with a computer can quickly become an EDM producer, the genre has become unlike any other.  With any other style of music, such as Rap or Country, large record labels dominate the industry and are usually required to experience success. This is where the EDM industry takes a sharp left turn – producers can work alone on their computers to create music and can publish new content whenever and wherever they want.  Joe Shmoe producing in his mom’s attic could become the newest, hottest producer overnight. The unpredictability and unregulated nature of the EDM industry makes is extremely hard to keep with new and quality EDM content.</p>

    <p>In the past few years, the main source for Electronic Dance Music has become websites such as YouTube and SoundCloud. While these websites are amazing in many ways, they don’t cater to finding quality content in a timely manner. We realized that there was no centralized source for EDM content, nor a quality, up-to-date ranking of content, where users could go and find what songs are new and popular in the click of a button. That is when EDM Headquarters was born.</p>

   <h3><strong>How does EDM Headquarters determine its rankings?</strong></h3>

    <p>By using a complex ranking algorithm, we are able to keep our charts up to date and reflective of what people are listening to right now. Our rankings are heavily dependent on you, the user, voting, so please vote for any songs that you like!!</p>
